# Raggd Documentation

Welcome to the Raggd knowledge base. Start here to understand the CLI bootstrap
experience, configuration model, and how to enable optional capabilities.

## Getting Started
- [Workspace bootstrap](learn/workspace.md): Initialize a workspace, manage
  refreshes, and understand configuration precedence.

## Reference
- API and module documentation will grow under `docs/api/` as the project
  evolves.
- Contribution and workflow guidance lives in `docs/contribute/`.
