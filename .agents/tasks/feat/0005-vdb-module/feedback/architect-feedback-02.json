  "summary": "Implementation aligns with the approved spec and addresses prior change requests (sidecar schema, CLI UX freeze, atomic rebuild, health and config details). Signing off.",

  "review": {
    "alignment": [
      "CLI commands and flags match the spec: info, create, sync, reset; flags include --json, --missing-only, --recompute, --limit, --concurrency, --dry-run.",
      "Deterministic index path derivation under sources/<source>/vectors/<vdb_name>/ with FAISS IDMap keyed by chunk_id.",
      "Provider abstraction (OpenAI-first) with batching, rate limits, retries, and token handling; dimension enforcement captured.",
      "SQLite remains authoritative for metadata across embedding_models, vdbs, chunks, vectors; FAISS stores only vector payloads.",
      "Health integration and info --json provide visibility for index presence, dim mismatches, counts drift, staleness, and orphaned refs."
    ],
    "previous_gaps_resolved": [
      "Sidecar metadata schema is defined with example (version, provider, model_id/name, dim, metric, index_type, vector_count, built_at, checksum).",
      "CLI UX and info --json schema are documented and frozen with examples.",
      "Atomic rebuild ordering and failure handling are described (temp write + atomic swap with single-writer lock).",
      "Concurrency=auto mapping and modules.vdb.* config keys are specified with defaults."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Ensure docs and CLI help remain in sync as implementation lands.",
      "Confirm checkhealth surfaces concise remediation guidance alongside codes/levels."
    ]
  },

  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "Info --json schema emitted as documented; includes selector, ids, counts, dim, paths, timestamps, and health entries.",
    "create is idempotent; sync supports --missing-only and --recompute with atomicity; reset clears vectors/chunks and optionally drops vdbs row.",
    "Dimension compatibility enforced across provider, DB, and FAISS index with fail-fast behavior.",
    "Deterministic faiss_path and sidecar written/updated during sync; checksum recorded."
